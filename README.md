# Neovim

My personal neovim configuration that has been a result of almost
10 years of vim/nvim use. Some small things may change every now and then
but I have largely settled on this base workflow and might make small changes as
project warrant them.

Feel free to make any suggestions!

The only regular update to this git repo will be the lazy-lock which reflects
plugin versions and I've found it useful enough for me to keep it tracked
and public.
